This is a simple resume that focuses on structure to make the information easily and quickly readable. The layout uses simple colors and 2 fonts to cut down on messiness. There is an overall structure and hierarchy that leads the eye through each section and subsequently down the entire page. Line length is short to keep the reader engaged as a line length too long would turn the reader off and simply look bad as a design.

The code uses some flexbox, for example in the navigation bar. There are percentages used so that the page scales as the window is displayed at various sizes. Elements are styled by class reference in CSS.
